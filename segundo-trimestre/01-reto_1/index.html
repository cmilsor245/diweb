      <p> All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>

      <p> In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag</li>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
        <p>You can learn more at the <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN Web Docs</a>.</p>

      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
        <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
            <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
            <li>To build web applications</li>
            <li>To impress friends</li>
            <li>To have fun</li>
          </ul>

      <p>üòÉ Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
